    <p>
        Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block-structured language. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages and is built using a modern approach to safety, and software design patterns by Apple Inc. for iOS applications, macOS applications, watchOS applications, tvOS applications. 
        Swift is easy to learn, easy to implement, safe, fast, and expressive. Developing Swift in the open has its exciting aspects as it is now free to be ported across a wide range of platforms, devices, and use cases.

    <p>
        The features of Swift are designed to work together to create a powerful language.<br> 
        Additional features of Swift include:<ul type="square">
        <li>Closures (similar to lambda functions in other languages) unified with function pointers</li>
        <li>Tuples and multiple return values</li>
        <li>Concise and fast iteration over a range or collection</li>
        <li>Structs and Classes that support methods, extensions, and protocols</li>
        <li>Functional programming patterns, e.g., map and filter</li>
        <li>Powerful error handling built-in</li>
        <li>Advanced control flow with do, guard, defer, and repeat keywords</li>
        <li>Optionals and force-unwrap</li></ul>
        <U><h3>Learning about Variables, Constants, Strings, and Operators</h3></U>
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Variables and Constants:</li>
            <ul type="square">
            <li>Variables: </li>These are named containers that store data within your program. You can think of them as boxes with labels where you can place and retrieve information. Their values can change throughout the code's execution.
            Declaring Variables: Use the var keyword followed by the variable name and a colon (:). Then, specify the data type (e.g., Int, String) separated by a space. Optionally, you can assign an initial value using the equal sign (=).</p>
            <li>Constants: </li>Similar to variables, constants hold data, but their values cannot be modified after they are set. Use the let keyword instead of var to declare constants.</ul>
            <li>Strings:</li>
            Strings represent sequences of characters, used for text data. In Swift, strings are enclosed in double quotes (").
            <li>Operators:</li>
            Operators are symbols that perform operations on data. Swift provides various operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more.
            Arithmetic Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division)
            Comparison Operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to)
            Logical Operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)</ol><br>
            <u><h3>Data Types in Swift </h3></u>

            <u><h3>Control Flow and Functions</h3></u>
            <p>Control Flow and Functions in Swift
                Swift offers powerful tools to control the flow of your program's execution and organize code into reusable blocks with functions.
                <ol>
                <li>Control Flow:</li>
                Control flow statements dictate how your program progresses based on conditions or loops.
                <ul type="square">
                <li>if Statements:</li> Used for conditional execution. The if statement checks a condition, and if it's true, the code within the block is executed. You can also have optional else and else if blocks for alternative scenarios.
                <li>switch Statements:</li> Provide a more concise way to handle multiple conditions based on a single value.
                <li>Loop Statements:</li> Allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
                <li>for-in Loops:</li> Ideal for iterating over sequences like arrays, strings, or ranges.
                <li>while Loops:</li> Execute code as long as a condition remains true.
                <li>repeat-while Loops:</li> Similar to while, but the code block executes at least once before checking the condition.
                <li>break and continue Statements:</li> Used within loops to control execution flow.
                <li>break:</li> Exits the loop completely.
                <li>continue:</li> Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.</ul>
                <li>Functions:</li>
                <ul type="square">
                Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They promote code organization, modularity, and readability.
                <li>Declaring Functions:</li> Use the func keyword followed by the function name, parameter list in parentheses, an optional return type after an arrow (->), and the function body enclosed in curly braces ({}).
                <li>Parameters and Arguments:</li>Functions can accept input values called parameters. When calling the function, you provide arguments (actual values) that match the parameter types.
                <li>Return Values: </li>Functions can optionally return a value using the return statement. The return type specifies the data type of the returned value.</ul></ol></p>
                <u><h3>Classes and Structures</h3></u>
                <p>In Swift, classes and structures are the fundamental building blocks for creating objects that encapsulate data (properties) and functionality (methods). While they share some similarities, they have key differences to consider when choosing which to use.
                    <ol>
                    <li>Classes:</li>
                    
                    Classes are reference types, meaning they store their data on the heap (a shared memory area). When you create a class instance (object), you get a reference to that memory location.
                    Classes support inheritance, allowing you to create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
                    They can manage their internal state and provide methods to access and modify that state.
                    <li>Structures:</li>
                    
                    Structures are value types, meaning they store their data directly within the instance itself. Copying a struct creates a completely new copy of the data.
                    They do not support inheritance.
                    Structs are generally simpler and more lightweight than classes. They are well-suited for representing small, well-defined pieces of data. <ul type="square">
                    <li>Choosing Between Classes and Structures:</li>
                    
                    Use structures by default for simple data holders.
                    Use classes when you need inheritance or complex object behavior with internal state management.
                    Consider structures for performance-critical areas where frequent copying might occur, as copying a struct is generally faster than copying a class reference.</ul></ol></p><br>
