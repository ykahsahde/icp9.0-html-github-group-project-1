      <p><u><h2>What is C?</h2></u>
        C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
        
        It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
        
        C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>
       <u> <h2>Variables & Constants in C</h2></u>
            <ol>
            <b><li>Variables</li></b>
            Variables in C are named memory locations used to store data that can vary during the execution of the program. They are defined with a specific data type that determines the size and type of data they can hold. Here are the key points about variables:
            <ul>
            <li>Declaration:</li> Before using a variable in C, you must declare it with a specific data type.
            <li> Initialization:</li> Variables can optionally be initialized at the time of declaration.
            <li>Assignment: </li>Once declared, variables can be assigned new values using the assignment operator (=).
            <li> Scope:</li> Variables have a scope that determines where in the program they can be accessed.</ul>

            <b><li>Constants</li></b>
            Constants in C are values that do not change during the execution of a program. They can be of any data type and are declared using the const keyword. Constants provide a way to make code more readable and maintainable by giving meaningful names to values that remain fixed.
            <ul>
            <li>Declaration:</li> Constants are declared using the const keyword followed by the data type and the constant name.
            <li>Usage: </li>Once declared, constants cannot be modified throughout the program execution:
            <li>Advantages:</li> Constants improve code readability by providing meaningful names to values that should not change. They also help prevent inadvertent modification of values.</ul></ol>
            <u><h2>Operators & Control flow in C </h2></u>
            <div><ol><P><b><li>Operators</li></b>
                Operators in C can be categorized into several types based on their functionality:
                <ul>
                <li>Arithmetic Operators:</li> Used for performing mathematical calculations:
                
                Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulus (%)
                <li>Relational Operators:</li> Used for comparing values:
                
                Equal to (==), Not equal to (!=), Greater than (>), Less than (<), Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than or equal to (<=)
                <li>Logical Operators:</li> Used to combine multiple conditions:
                
                Logical AND (&&), Logical OR (||), Logical NOT (!)
                <li>Assignment Operators:</li> Used to assign values to variables:
                
                Assignment (=), Addition assignment (+=), Subtraction assignment (-=), Multiplication assignment (*=), Division assignment (/=), Modulus assignment (%=)
                <li>Increment and Decrement Operators:</li> Used to increase or decrease the value of a variable:
                
                Increment (++), Decrement (--)
                <li>Bitwise Operators:</li> Used for manipulation of bits in integers:
                
                Bitwise AND (&), Bitwise OR (|), Bitwise XOR (^), Bitwise NOT (~), Left shift (<<), Right shift (>>)
                <li>Ternary Operator:</li> Conditional operator for decision making:
                condition ? expression1 : expression2</ul></P>
                <P><b><li>Control Flow Statements</li></b>
                    Control flow statements dictate the order in which statements in your code are executed based on certain conditions or loops. Key control flow statements in C include:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Conditional Statements:</li>
                    <ol>
                    <li>if statement:</li>
                   
                    <li>if-else statement:</li>
                    
                    <li>else-if ladder:</li>
                   </ol>
                    <li>Switch Statement:</li> Used to select one of many code blocks to be executed:
                    <li>Loops:</li>
                    <ol>
                    <li>while loop:</li> Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
                    <li>do-while loop:</li> Similar to the while loop but guarantees that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition.
                    <li>for loop:</li> Executes a block of code a specified number of times.</ol>
                    </ul></P></ol></div>
                    <u><h2>File handling & Error Handling</h2></u>
                    <div><ol><p><b><li>File Handling in C</li></b><ul>
                        File handling in C involves operations to read from and write to files. This process typically involves the following steps:
                        
                        <li>File Pointer:</li> In C, a file is accessed using a file pointer (FILE *). This pointer maintains information about the file being accessed.
                        
                        <li>Opening a File:</li> Before reading from or writing to a file, you need to open it using the fopen() function:
                        <li>Reading from a File:</li> You can use functions like fscanf() or fgets() to read data from a file:
                        <li>Writing to a File:</li> Use functions like fprintf() or fputs() to write data to a file:
                        <li>Closing a File:</li> Always close the file using fclose() once you’re done with it to free up resources:
                        <li>Error Handling:</li> Check the return value of fopen() to ensure the file was opened successfully. If fp is NULL, an error occurred.</ul></p>
                    <p><b><li>Error Handling in C</li></b><ul>
                        Error handling in C involves managing unexpected situations or errors that may occur during program execution. Common techniques include:
                        
                        <li>Return Values:</li> Functions in C often return values indicating success or failure (0 for success, -1 or NULL for failure). Always check return values for errors, especially when dealing with file operations (fopen(), fclose(), etc.).
                        
                        <li>Error Codes:</li> Standard library functions like errno and perror() can help diagnose errors:
                        <li>Custom Error Handling:</li> Use conditional statements (if, else, switch) to handle specific errors:
                        <li>Error Reporting:</li> Print informative error messages to stderr (fprintf(stderr, ...)):
                        <li>Cleanup:</li> Always clean up resources (like closing files with fclose()) before exiting due to an error to prevent resource leaks.</ul></p></ol></div>
